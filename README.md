Bipolar disorder is a severe and heterogeneous mental illness characterised by recurrent manic and depressive episodes, the onset and course of which may be influenced by psychosocial, environmental, and biological stressors. Genetic variation contributes substantially to bipolar disorder susceptibility, yet identifying specific variants associated with stress-related disease trajectories remains challenging. This repository documents analyses examining associations between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes and the presence of stressors prior to the first episode of bipolar disorder. A total of 114 SNPs from stress- and bipolar disorder–related candidate genes were analysed in a cohort of 550 individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Patients were stratified based on reported presence or absence of stressors before disease onset. Genotyping was performed using TaqMan assays, and statistical analyses included Pearson’s chi-square tests and Bayesian hypothesis testing. Significant differences in genotype distribution were identified in six polymorphisms, with ADRA2A/rs3750625 and AVPR1B/rs28536160 showing robust associations with stress exposure prior to onset. The AC genotype of ADRA2A/rs3750625 was associated with increased risk, whereas the CT genotype of AVPR1B/rs28536160 showed a protective association, supported by Bayes factor analysis. These findings highlight stress-sensitive genetic variation within adrenergic and vasopressin signaling pathways in bipolar disorder and provide a reproducible framework for investigating gene–stressor interactions. Further functional and mechanistic studies are required to clarify the biological and clinical implications of these variants.
